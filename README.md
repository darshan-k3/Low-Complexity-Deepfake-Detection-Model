# Low Complexity Deepfake Detection Comparative Study

Implementation of Comparisons between 11 models that utilise SVM, MLP, Xception and Meso architectures.
Includes Creation of Benchmark Dataset, T-SNE and Results Visualisations.
Please refer to the user guide for additional information.

# 1. Getting Started

Please don't rerun the Creation of Benchmark Dataset file, this file is for illustration purposes.
The main runs for unimodal and multimodal models contain results when you scroll down to the bottom of each code block.

# 2. Model Training

Run cell blocks in order, unless instructions in the code state otherwise 

# 3. T-SNE Visualisations

Run cell blocks in order, unless instructions in the code state otherwise

# 4. Results

The Results.ipynb file runs as a standalone file because results are hardcoded.
