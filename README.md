# Low Complexity Deepfake Detection Comparative Study

Implementation of Comparisons between 11 models that utilise SVM, MLP, Xception and Meso architectures.
Includes Creation of Benchmark Dataset, T-SNE and Results Visualisations.

Please don't rerun the Creation of Benchmark Dataset, this file is for illustration purposes.
The main runs for unimodal and multimodal models contain results when you scroll down to the bottom of each code block.

The Results.ipynb file runs as a standalone file because results are hardcoded.
